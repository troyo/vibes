# World Monitor

> Real-time global intelligence dashboard — AI-powered news aggregation, geopolitical monitoring, and infrastructure tracking in a unified situational awareness interface.

World Monitor is an open-source (AGPL-3.0) intelligence platform that aggregates 150+ news feeds, 35+ interactive map layers, and multiple AI models into a single dashboard. It runs as a web app, installable PWA, and native desktop application (Tauri) for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

A single codebase produces three specialized variants — geopolitical, technology, and finance — each with distinct feeds, panels, map layers, and branding. The tri-variant architecture uses build-time selection via the VITE_VARIANT environment variable, with runtime switching available via the header bar.

The project is built with TypeScript, Vite, MapLibre GL JS, deck.gl, D3.js, and Tauri. All intelligence analysis (clustering, instability scoring, surge detection) runs client-side in the browser — no backend compute dependency for core intelligence. A browser-side ML pipeline (Transformers.js) provides NER and sentiment analysis without server dependency.
